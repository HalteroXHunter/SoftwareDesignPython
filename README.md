Source files for the book "Software Design for Python Progammers" by Ronald Mak.

The files for each example program are zipped. All the example programs 
were tested with Python 3.12, although most can also work with earler versions 
starting with Python 3.10.

Unzip the source files each program into a directory and run its main code
from that directory. For example, to run the Program 2.4 in directory 
Python2.4-Books-4, use the following commands:

    cd Python2.4-Books-4
    python main.py
